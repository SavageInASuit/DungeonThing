# DungeonThing

An in progress dungeon game prototype written in Java, using OpenGL via the Light Weight Java Gaming Library and Slick2D.

The LWJGL and Slick2D files are needed to get this up and running in Eclipse

Clone and set the Gameproto file as your workspace on Eclipse.
Add the LWJGL and Slick jars to your Eclipse build path libraries, and point it towards the LWJGL native files relevant
to your OS.

These steps should allow you to run this project in its current state.
